Odoo Connector
==============

Odoo Connector is a very basic library that allows you to connect your Python script with your Odoo instance.

It provides basic odoo functions:

- search
- search_read
- read
- browse
- write
- create
- unlink

*Browse isn't implemented and you shouldn't use it, is too slow!<br/>
With "search", "read" or "search_read" you can do all that you need.*

Roadmap
-------
- Multithreading create is under development
- Error control
- More... XD
